Non-Floating-Point-Calculator
=============================

The goal of this project was to build a computer-based symbolic math system that avoids floating-point representations 
as much as possible. Rather than say 4/6 = 0.666, it would say that 4/6 =  2/3, etc. 
This project utilizes many different algorithms to parse the expressions and to return the exact answer.
